frontend=> go client folder(./client) => npm install (To install all necessary dependencies)

backend=> same as it is like frontend but
       => create one .env file(yes same name as it is) root file(./server)
           => add MONGO_URI
           => PORT = "any" example = 8080
           => SECRET_KEY = "random name" example = "Web-12345"

and at last run both folder by using "npm run dev" command
